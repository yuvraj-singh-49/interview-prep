# Amazon Leadership Principles

## Overview

Amazon's 16 Leadership Principles (LPs) are the foundation of their interview process. Even if you're not interviewing at Amazon, these principles are valuable for any tech company interview as they cover universal leadership competencies.

Each interviewer typically covers 2-3 LPs with ~15 minutes per principle. Prepare 2-3 stories for each principle.

## The 16 Leadership Principles

### 1. Customer Obsession

> Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust.

**What they're looking for:**
- Prioritizing customer needs over internal politics
- Making decisions based on customer impact
- Going above and beyond for customers
- Understanding customer pain points deeply

**Sample Questions:**
- Tell me about a time you prioritized customer needs over business metrics
- Describe a situation where you had to advocate for the customer
- How have you gathered customer feedback to improve a product?

**Story Template:**
```
Situation: Customer complaint/need identified
Task: Your role in addressing it
Action: Steps to understand and solve customer problem
Result: Customer satisfaction improvement, retention, NPS
```

**Lead-Level Example:**
"Our enterprise customers were churning at 15% annually. I initiated a customer research program, personally interviewed 20 customers, and identified that our onboarding process was the main pain point. I redesigned the onboarding flow, reducing time-to-value from 3 weeks to 3 days. Churn dropped to 5%."

### 2. Ownership

> Leaders are owners. They think long-term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company.

**What they're looking for:**
- Taking responsibility beyond your role
- Long-term thinking
- Not saying "that's not my job"
- Fixing problems even when not assigned

**Sample Questions:**
- Tell me about a time you took on something outside your responsibility
- Describe a situation where you saw a problem and fixed it without being asked
- When have you sacrificed short-term gains for long-term value?

**Lead-Level Example:**
"I noticed our monitoring was inadequate for a system I didn't own. Instead of filing a ticket, I spent two weekends building comprehensive dashboards and alerts. When an outage occurred months later, the team caught it in minutes instead of hours. I've since made monitoring a standard part of our design reviews."

---

### 3. Invent and Simplify

> Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams. They are externally aware, look for new ideas everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here."

**What they're looking for:**
- Creating new solutions vs. copying existing ones
- Simplifying complex processes
- Being open to external ideas
- Challenging status quo

**Sample Questions:**
- Tell me about a time you simplified a complex process
- Describe an innovative solution you created
- When have you implemented an idea from outside your team/company?

**Lead-Level Example:**
"Our deployment process had 47 manual steps. I researched industry practices, combined GitOps patterns with our specific needs, and built a single-command deployment system. What took 2 hours now takes 10 minutes, and we reduced deployment errors by 80%."

---

### 4. Are Right, A Lot

> Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

**What they're looking for:**
- Good decision-making track record
- Using data to inform decisions
- Seeking input before deciding
- Admitting when wrong

**Sample Questions:**
- Tell me about a time your judgment was questioned but you turned out to be right
- Describe a decision you made that was unpopular but correct
- When did you seek out diverse perspectives before making a decision?

**Lead-Level Example:**
"I recommended against a popular framework choice despite team preference. I gathered benchmark data, analyzed maintenance costs, and presented a comparison. The team initially disagreed, but after seeing the data, we chose my recommendation. Two years later, the popular framework was deprecated, validating our choice."

---

### 5. Learn and Be Curious

> Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

**What they're looking for:**
- Continuous learning mindset
- Exploring new technologies
- Learning from failures
- Seeking feedback

**Sample Questions:**
- Tell me about a time you had to learn something new quickly
- How do you stay current with industry trends?
- Describe a situation where curiosity led to a significant improvement

**Lead-Level Example:**
"I noticed machine learning was transforming our industry. I took evening courses, built prototype projects, and eventually led a hackathon team that created an ML-based feature. That prototype evolved into a product feature that improved conversion by 25%."

---

### 6. Hire and Develop the Best

> Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent and willingly move them throughout the organization.

**What they're looking for:**
- Hiring decisions and rationale
- Mentoring and developing others
- Raising team capabilities
- Giving and receiving feedback

**Sample Questions:**
- Tell me about a time you mentored someone
- Describe a hire you made and how it worked out
- How have you helped someone grow in their career?

**Lead-Level Example:**
"I identified a junior engineer struggling with code reviews. Instead of reassigning work, I created a structured mentorship program - weekly 1:1s, paired programming, and gradual responsibility increases. Within 8 months, they became our most thorough code reviewer and now mentor others."

---

### 7. Insist on the Highest Standards

> Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high.

**What they're looking for:**
- Not accepting mediocrity
- Pushing for quality
- Setting high bars for yourself and team
- Quality over speed when appropriate

**Sample Questions:**
- Tell me about a time you pushed back on something that didn't meet your standards
- Describe a situation where you raised the quality bar
- When have your high standards caused friction?

**Lead-Level Example:**
"Our test coverage was at 40% and bugs were frequent. I established a minimum 80% coverage requirement and automated quality gates. Initially there was pushback about velocity, but bug rates dropped 60% and overall delivery speed improved as we spent less time on fixes."

---

### 8. Think Big

> Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

**What they're looking for:**
- Ambitious vision
- Not constrained by current limitations
- Inspiring others with vision
- Thinking beyond immediate scope

**Sample Questions:**
- Tell me about your most ambitious project
- How have you inspired a team with a bold vision?
- Describe a time you thought beyond the immediate problem

**Lead-Level Example:**
"Instead of patching our outdated system, I proposed a complete platform rebuild using modern architecture. I created a 3-year roadmap, secured executive buy-in, and led the migration in phases. We now handle 10x the load with half the infrastructure cost."

---

### 9. Bias for Action

> Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

**What they're looking for:**
- Taking action without perfect information
- Calculated risks
- Not over-analyzing
- Speed of decision-making

**Sample Questions:**
- Tell me about a time you made a decision with incomplete information
- Describe a situation where you took a calculated risk
- When have you acted quickly to prevent a problem?

**Lead-Level Example:**
"During a production incident, I had two potential root causes but limited time to investigate both. I made a judgment call based on available signals, implemented a fix, and resolved the issue in 30 minutes. Post-mortem confirmed my hypothesis was correct."

---

### 10. Frugality

> Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention.

**What they're looking for:**
- Achieving results with limited resources
- Not throwing money at problems
- Creative solutions to resource constraints
- Efficiency improvements

**Sample Questions:**
- Tell me about a time you achieved more with less
- How have you optimized costs?
- Describe a creative solution to a resource constraint

**Lead-Level Example:**
"Facing budget cuts, I couldn't hire needed engineers. I automated manual processes, improved developer tooling to increase productivity 40%, and reprioritized work. We delivered all committed features without new hires and reduced operational costs by $200K annually."

---

### 11. Earn Trust

> Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward.

**What they're looking for:**
- Building trust through actions
- Being transparent, even with bad news
- Self-awareness and humility
- Listening to others

**Sample Questions:**
- Tell me about a time you had to deliver bad news
- How have you built trust with a skeptical stakeholder?
- Describe a situation where you admitted a mistake publicly

**Lead-Level Example:**
"My architecture recommendation caused a production issue. I immediately owned the mistake in the incident review, documented what went wrong, and implemented safeguards. The transparency strengthened team trust, and my subsequent recommendations were still valued because I'd shown accountability."

---

### 12. Dive Deep

> Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, and audit frequently. No task is beneath them.

**What they're looking for:**
- Getting into technical details
- Not just delegating blindly
- Understanding systems deeply
- Hands-on leadership

**Sample Questions:**
- Tell me about a time you had to dive deep into data/code
- How do you stay connected to technical details as a leader?
- Describe a situation where details revealed a bigger problem

**Lead-Level Example:**
"As tech lead, I noticed an unusual pattern in our metrics. Instead of delegating, I spent a day analyzing logs and discovered a subtle memory leak affecting 5% of requests. The investigation led to a fix that improved P99 latency by 200ms."

---

### 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

> Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable. Once decided, they commit wholly.

**What they're looking for:**
- Speaking up against popular opinion
- Constructive disagreement
- Committing after decision is made
- Standing firm with conviction

**Sample Questions:**
- Tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager
- Describe a situation where you pushed back on a team decision
- How have you committed to a decision you disagreed with?

**Lead-Level Example:**
"I disagreed with our VP's choice of database technology. I presented data and alternatives in a meeting, was overruled after discussion, and then fully committed to making it work. I became the team's expert on that technology to ensure success."

---

### 14. Deliver Results

> Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion.

**What they're looking for:**
- Track record of delivery
- Overcoming obstacles
- Meeting commitments
- Prioritizing effectively

**Sample Questions:**
- Tell me about a time you delivered under pressure
- Describe your most challenging project and how you delivered
- When have you overcome significant obstacles to deliver?

**Lead-Level Example:**
"With 3 weeks to launch and a critical dependency team unable to deliver, I led my team in building a temporary solution while coordinating with the other team. We launched on time, then migrated to their solution later without customer impact."

---

### 15. Strive to be Earth's Best Employer

> Leaders work to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment.

**What they're looking for:**
- Creating positive work environment
- Supporting team wellbeing
- Promoting inclusion
- Building sustainable practices

**Sample Questions:**
- How have you contributed to team culture?
- Tell me about a time you supported a struggling team member
- How do you promote work-life balance?

**Lead-Level Example:**
"I noticed burnout signs in my team during a long project. I instituted 'no-meeting Wednesdays', pushed back on unrealistic deadlines, and created a rotation for on-call. Team satisfaction scores improved 40%, and we retained all our engineers."

---

### 16. Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility

> Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than they found them.

**What they're looking for:**
- Broader impact thinking
- Community contribution
- Sustainability focus
- Long-term thinking

**Sample Questions:**
- How have you contributed beyond your immediate team?
- Tell me about a time you considered broader impact in a decision
- How do you think about the responsibility that comes with scale?

**Lead-Level Example:**
"Our system processed millions of requests using significant compute. I led an efficiency initiative that reduced our carbon footprint equivalent to removing 100 cars from the road annually. I presented at internal tech talks to spread these practices."
